# symfony4-alias
Some alias that will make your life easy and improuve your coding speed. With this you will type too much less to produce the same.

An alias is a short cut command to a longer command, they are often set in the ~/.bashrc, if you are using a virtual machine (linux)
you can use this powerful feature and make your life easy. If you are coding under windows, oh com'on please move... use Docker or 
Homestead.

In the Alias file, you will find a short list of the most used commands in symfony 4, you  can do the same thing in Laravel, you can add
as much alias as you want just use a specific logic while naming them so you don't forget them.

When you add more usefull alias, please share them with us!

Happy coding ^^
